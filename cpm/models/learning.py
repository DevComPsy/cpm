class DeltaRule:
    """
    DeltaRule class computes the prediction error for a given input and target value.
    It is based on the Gluck and Bower's (1988) delta rule, an extension to Rescorla
    and Wagner (1972), which was identical to that of Widrow and Hoff (1960).

    Attributes
    ----------
    alpha : float
        The learning rate.
    input : ndarray or array_like
        The input value. The stimulus representation in the form of a 1D array, where each element can take a value of 0 and 1.
    weights : ndarray
        The weights value. A 2D array of weights, where each row represents an outcome and each column represents a single stimulus.
    teacher : ndarray
        The target values or feedback, sometimes referred to as teaching signals. These are the values that the algorithm should learn to predict.
    shape : tuple
        The shape of the weight matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
        The learning rate.
    weights : array-like
        The input value. The stimulus representation in the form of a 1D array, where each element can take a value of 0 and 1.
    feedback : array-like
        The target values or feedback, sometimes referred to as teaching signals. These are the values that the algorithm should learn to predict.
    input : array-like
        The input value. The stimulus representation in the form of a 1D array, where each element can take a value of 0 and 1.
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments.

    [cpm.models.learning.SeparableRule][cpm.models.learning.SeparableRule] : A class representing a learning rule based on the separable error-term of Bush and Mosteller (1951).

    Notes
    -----

    The delta-rule is a summed error term, which means that the error is defined as
    the difference between the target value and the summed activation of all values
    for a given output unit available on the current trial/state. For separable
    error term, see the Bush and Mosteller (1951) rule.

    The current implementation is based on the Gluck and Bower's (1988) delta rule, an
    extension of the Rescorla and Wagner (1972) learning rule to multi-outcome learning.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from cpm.components.learning import DeltaRule
    >>> weights = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]])
    >>> teacher = np.array([1, 0])
    >>> input = np.array([1, 1, 0])
    >>> delta_rule = DeltaRule(alpha=0.1, weights=weights, feedback=teacher, input=input)
    >>> delta_rule.compute()
    array([[ 0.04,  0.04,  0.  ],
           [-0.15, -0.15, -0.  ]])

    This implementation generalises to n-dimensional weight matrices, which means
    that it can be applied to both single- and multi-outcome learning paradigms.

    >>> weights = np.array([0.1, 0.6, 0., 0.3])
    >>> teacher = np.array([1])
    >>> input = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0])
