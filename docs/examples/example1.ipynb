    "This is a beginner's walkthrough of an associative learning model and the blocking effect. The model is an instance of the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972), which is a simple and widely used model of associative learning. The blocking effect (Kamin, 1961) is a well-known phenomenon in the psychology of learning, and it was the original target phenomena for the Rescorla-Wagner model."

    "## The Blocking Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The blocking effect (Kamin, 1961) is a type of cue competition when learning about one cue is restricted in the presence of another cue that was trained separately.\n",
    "In a simple example, consider a rat that has been trained to associate light (A) with food (+). and subsequently encounters the compound of light and sound (AB) with food (+). Under these conditions, learning about B is restricted.\n",
    "In humans, learning (in associative or contingency learning experiments) is often measured by asking them to rate the likelihood of an outcome (e.g., food) given a cue (e.g., light).\n",
    "Participants rate blocked cues (B) as less likely to result in an outcome than a control cue (e.g. X following Y- and XY+ training).\n",
    "This is the blocking effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the toolbox to fit the Bush and Mosteller (1951) separable error term and the Rescorla-Wagner (1972) summed-error term to data from a blocking experiment.\n",
    "It is a partial recreation of Spicer et al. (2021)."
