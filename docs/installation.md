# Getting Started

Welcome to the [Project Name] documentation! This guide will help you get started with [Project Name] and provide you with the necessary information to begin using it effectively.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites that you need to install for `cpm`.
It is written completely in python, so most dependencies (other python packages) are installed alongside it if they are missing from your system.

Note that some tools, such as `scipy`, might require some C++ compilers that are not present on Windows by default. It is up to you to check dependencies specific to your setup! If you are still struggling, try the Discussion forum, see below.

## Installation

To install `cpm`, simply type:

```bash
pip install cpm-toolbox
```

Note that this is not yet available!

## Unstable Version

To install the unstable version, use this command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/DevComPsy/cpm.git
```
