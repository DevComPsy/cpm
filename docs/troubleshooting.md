# Troubleshooting

There are two major types of issues you might encounter when using the `cpm`: problems with the `cpm` itself, bugs, and troubleshooting issues (not knowing how to get something done).

If you have identified a problem with the `cpm`, such as a bug and the code or an error in the documentation, please report it to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/DevComPsy/modelling-toolbox/issues).

If you are having trouble with the `cpm` itself, such as installation issues or trying to get something to work, please refer to the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/DevComPsy/modelling-toolbox/discussions) page.
Please search through the archive of Q&As before posting a new question.
